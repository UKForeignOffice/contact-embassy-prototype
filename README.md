# Contact an embassy prototype

This prototype app is for user testing rather than production use. 

It was created to user test a new flow for 'Contact an embassy'.

## Setup

```
npm i
```

## Running locally
```
npm start
```

Then hit http://localhost:3000

## Navigating the prototype
To populate the list of topics, you need to upload a CSV file - an example is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UypMwZzPRPx3OZcn7LJYauD20ftzV2SBLwMblVHR3Y0/edit#gid=0).

To modify the topic structure, you can edit the titles and links before uploading.

After uploading the CSV, you’ll be forwarded to an embassy page. Click on the link “contact us online” under the “Urgent assistance” section, to be forwarded to the Contact us page.
